# Tiresias: The Blind Seer

Will Christopher Nolan's _The Odyssey_ (2026) make money? Will it win any awards? And perhaps most importantly of all, _will I like it??_

Tiresias is here to peer into the future and let us know.

Read all about it <!-- [here](link/to/substack). -->

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> I'm planning to simplify this installation as much as possible (i.e. deploy a web app) before releasing version 1.0.
> But for now, this is the best we've got.
